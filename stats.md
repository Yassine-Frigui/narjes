## A. Crucial

### 1. Reservation Metrics

- **Cancellations vs No-Shows**: Count and rate of each, with trends over time.

### 2. Revenue Metrics
- **Total Revenue**: Aggregate revenue for selected periods.
- **Breakdown by Service Type**: Revenue per service (pie chart or bar graph).
- **Average Spend per Client**: Total revenue divided by unique clients in the period.

### 3. Client Management
- **New vs Returning Clients**: Ratio and counts, with trend lines.
- **Retention Rates**: Percentage of clients who return within a set period (e.g., 30/60/90 days).
- **Loyal/VIP Customers**: Identify clients with the most visits or highest spend.
